# Craig Webapp Server

This is the server for the [Craig Webapp](https://github.com/CraigChat/webapp), allowing for Discord bot shards to connect to it and accept connections and data.

You can run `pnpm start` to start the server and run `pnpm start:test-client` to create a client that will be connected with the ID and key as "test".
